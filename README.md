# SQL_for_Data_Science
## About
"SQL for Data Science" is a course by UC Davis and offered through Coursera. The final step to complete the course is a final project which goes through all of the querying concepts taught through the course.
## Background
You are a Data Scientist working at the USDA. Your department has been tracking the production of various agricultural commodities across different states. 

My datasets include:

`milk_production`, `cheese_production`, `coffee_production`, `honey_production`, `yogurt_production`, and a `state_lookup` table. 

The data spans multiple years and states, with varying levels of production for each commodity.

Your manager has requested that you generate insights from this data to aid in future planning and decision-making. You'll need to use SQL queries to answer the questions that come up in meetings, reports, or strategic discussions.
## Objectives
Objectives:
- Assess state-by-state production for each commodity.
- Identify trends or anomalies.
- Offer data-backed suggestions for areas that may need more attention.
## Additional Info
- SQLite is being used as the language with DBeaver as the SQL Editor.
